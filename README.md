**Lesson's topic:**

Project structure. Git.

**Technical task:**

Write a program that calculates the area of geometric shapes: circle, square, rectangle.
In real projects, it is good practice to keep only working and tested versions of the application in master. Therefore, after the first commit, we immediately create a new branch dev and write an application for calculating the area of a circle in it. Then, in a separate branch, for several commits, we add the function for the square. And in a separate branch - for the rectangle. And we merge all this into the dev branch, and only then we merge it with master.
